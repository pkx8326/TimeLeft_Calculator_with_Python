# TimeLeft_Calculator_with_Python
This simple Python program calculates the approx. time you still have left on this earth based on the life expectancy of your country and your current age. It tells you how many years (converted to months and days) you still have left based on the fact that there are 12 months, or (usually) 365 days in a year.
